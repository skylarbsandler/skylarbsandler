## About Me
Thanks for dropping by! I am a software developer and a graduate of the Launch Program at the Turing School of Software & Design.

I have always been a naturally curious person which led to me also having interests in many different career paths.

I initially pursued a career as a counselor in a collegiate counseling center as the relationships I had with counselors were instrumental to my college experience. 
After finding community and meaning within various student involvement groups, I enrolled in UConnâ€™s Master in Higher Education program with the goal of helping college students find fulfillment on campus. When COVID hit halfway through my first year, I realized that there were institutional barriers that would limit my impact in the higher education field. This was also around when I first had exposure to coding through self-learning on Codecademy.

I subsequently took roles in customer success for the Masters of Data Science Program at the University of California, Berkeley, and in campus recruiting at an engineering firm. 
In both of these roles, I noticed myself gravitating more toward the technical work of my colleagues. Coupled with my continued interest in coding, I took this as my sign to dive headfirst into pursuing a career in software development and enrolling in the Turing School of Software & Design to commit myself to learning full-time. 

Throughout my career journey thus far, I have always been driven to help others and contribute to solving complex problems. I have a passion for growth and taking on tough challenges, with both the small details and the big picture in mind. 
I am excited to join a new field with excitement and endless possibilities. I aspire to join a team with a strong sense of community, commitment, and learning.
