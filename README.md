  I have always been a naturally curious person which led to me also having interests in many different career paths.

I initially pursued a career as a counselor in a collegiate counseling center as the relationships I had with counselors were instrumental to my college experience. 
After finding community and meaning within various student involvement groups, I enrolled in UConnâ€™s Master in Higher Education program with the goal of helping college students find fulfillment on campus. When COVID hit halfway through my first year, I realized that there were institutional barriers that would limit my impact in the higher education field. This was also around when I first had exposure to coding through self-learning on Codecademy.

I subsequently took roles as a Student Advisor for the Masters of Data Science Program at the University of California, Berkeley, and as a Campus Recruiter at an engineering firm. 
In both of these roles, I noticed myself gravitating more toward the technical work of my colleagues. Coupled with my continued interest in coding, I took this as my sign to dive headfirst into pursuing a career in software development and enrolling in the Turing School of Software & Design to commit myself to learning full-time. 

Throughout my career journey thus far, I have always been driven to help others and contribute to solving complex problems. I have a passion for growth and taking on tough challenges, with both the small details and the big picture in mind. 
I am excited to join a new field with excitement and endless possibilities. I aspire to join a team with a strong sense of community, commitment, and learning.
